TASK I:
For responisve design I would like to use: 
    # SCSS for image aspect ratio, 
    # flexbox grid, 
    # media query and would like to see 
    # hamburg menu when screen xs size ~320px.
    
So all contain keep in container-fluid, 
  then use rows and columns adapted how they will change with different screen size (from x's to lg) and 
  thanks to media query make some corrections, which include:
    + on xs screen size logo goes to up,
    + on xs screen size Search bar without button,
    + on xs screen size adding hamburger menu (navigation bar).

    

TASK II:
Data from the API presented as static HTML page without adding any external libraries and frameworks like Angular, React, Bootstrap and similar.
